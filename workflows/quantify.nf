/**
 * Workflow to quantify mappings.
 *
 * This stage is commonly referred to as something like "counting reads."
 * We choose quantify because we find that this encompasses counting reads as well as other methods of quantification, e.g. pseudoalignment
 * 
 * @take alignments the sorted and indexed aligned/mapped reads channel of format [metadata, BAM, BAM.BAI].
 * @take annotations the reference annotations in GTF format. Can be gzipped.
 *
 * @emit quantify_log the output logs/summary/QC files from the quantification tool.
